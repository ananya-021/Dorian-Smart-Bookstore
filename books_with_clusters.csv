present we with a disturbing reality otherness the simple fact of be different in some way have come to be define as in and of itself evil miroslav volf contend that if the heal word of the gospel be to be hear today christian theology must find way of speak that address the hatred of the other reach back to the new testament metaphor of salvation as reconciliation volf propose the idea of embrace as a theological response to the problem of exclusion increasingly we see that exclusion have become the primary sin skew our perception of reality and cause we to react out of fear and anger to all those who be not within our evernarrowing circle in light of this christian must learn that salvation come not only as we be reconcile to god and not only as we learn to live with one another but as we take the dangerous and costly step of open ourselves to the other of enfold he or she in the same embrace with which we have be enfold by god be there any hope of embrace our enemy of open the door to reconciliation miroslav volf a yale university theologian have win the 2002 louisville grawemeyer award in religion for his book exclusion embrace a theological exploration of identity otherness and reconciliation abingdon 1996 volf argue that exclusion of people who be alien or different be among the most intractable problem in the world today he write it may not be too much to claim that the future of our world will depend on how we deal with identity and difference the issue be urgent the ghetto and battlefield throughout the worldin the live room in inner city or on the mountain rangestestify indisputably to its importance a croatian by birth volf take as a starting point for his analysis the recent civil war and ethnic cleansing in the former yugoslavia but he readily find other example of cultural ethnic and racial conflict to illustrate his point and since september 11 one can scarcely help but plug the new world player into his incisive description of the dynamic of interethnic and international strife exclusion happen volf argue wherever impenetrable barrier be set up that prevent a creative encounter with the other it be easy to assume that exclusion be the problem or practice of barbarian who live over there but volf persuade we that exclusion be all too often our practice here as well modern western society include american society typically recite their history as narrative of inclusion and volf celebrate the truth in these narrative but he point out that these narrative conveniently omit certain group who disturb the integrity of their happy ending plot therefore such narrative of inclusion invite long and gruesome counternarrative of exclusionthe brutal history of slavery and of the decimation of native american population come readily to mind but more current example could also be find most propose solution to the problem of exclusion have focus on social arrangementswhat kind of society ought we to create in order to accommodate individual or communal difference volf focus rather on what kind of self we need to be in order to live in harmony with other in address the topic volf stress the social implication of divine selfgive the christian scriptures attest that god do not abandon the godless to their evil but give of godself to bring they into communion we be call to do likewisewhoever our enemy and whoever we may be the divine mandate to embrace as god have embrace be summarize in pauls injunction to the romans welcome one another therefore just as christ have welcome you romans 157 susan r garrett coordinator of the religion award say that the grawemeyer selection committee praise volfs book on many count these include its profound interpretation of certain pivotal passage of scripture and its brilliant engagement with contemporary theology philosophy critical theory and feminist theory volfs focus be not on social strategy or program but rather on show we new way to understand ourselves and our relation to our enemy he help we to imagine new possibility for live against violence injustice and deception garrett add that although address primarily to christians volfs theological statement open itself to religious pluralism by uphold the importance of different religious and cultural tradition for the formation of personal and group identity the call to embrace the other be never a call to
